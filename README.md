## Oscillate

https://oscillate.herokuapp.com/

This project has been chipped away at for a number of years and is designed to
provide a visual model of the wave equation:

```
v = f * λ

Wave speed v
Wavelength λ
Frequency f
```

Oscillate is a teaching tool built using three.js and TypeScript.

The model's particle count, wave frequency and wave speed can be adjusted using sliders. When these configurable options are changed the new wave will propagate from the point of origin.
